# Mini Project: Communication Models and Protocols

This repository contains the implementation of the Mini Project for **CCS112 - Communication Models and Protocols**, focusing on designing and implementing communication protocols for bid timing mechanisms.

## üìú Project Overview
The project demonstrates the use of **Client-Server** and **Publisher-Subscriber** models for managing bid timing and profit updates in an auction system. It emphasizes efficient and user-friendly communication protocols.

### Key Features
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - Implements bid timing with a diagrammatic representation.
  - Ensures unique Client IDs via session-based IP address assignment.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Model**:
  - Provides real-time notifications for bid updates and new items.
  - Continuous notification delivery until acknowledgment.
- **Transport Layer Protocol**:
  - Uses UDP to ensure real-time, low-latency communication.
- **Application Layer Functionality**:
  - Implements acknowledgment-based notification delivery.

## üîß Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Notify subscribers of new bids and items.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Immediate and uninterrupted notifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: For server and client implementations.
- **UDP Protocol**: For communication.
- **Custom Protocol Design**: Application-level acknowledgment handling.
