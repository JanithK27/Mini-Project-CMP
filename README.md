# Mini Project: Auction_System

This repository contains the implementation of the Mini Project for **CCS112 - Communication Models and Protocols**, focusing on designing and implementing communication protocols for bid timing mechanisms.

## üìú Project Overview
The project demonstrates the use of **Client-Server** and **Publisher-Subscriber** models for managing bid timing and profit updates in an auction system. It emphasizes efficient and user-friendly communication protocols.

### Key Features
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - Implements bid timing with a diagrammatic representation.
  - Ensures unique Client IDs via session-based IP address assignment.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Model**:
  - Provides real-time notifications for bid updates and new items.
  - Continuous notification delivery until acknowledgment.
- **Transport Layer Protocol**:
  - Uses UDP to ensure real-time, low-latency communication.
- **Application Layer Functionality**:
  - Implements acknowledgment-based notification delivery.

## üîß Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Notify subscribers of new bids and items.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Immediate and uninterrupted notifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Transport Layer Protocol**: UDP
- **Libraries/Tools**: OpenCV (if used for any visualization tasks), NumPy
- **Additional Tools**: Custom Python scripts for client-server communication

## üìñ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install **Python 3.x** on your system.
3. Install **MySQL** and set it up on your local machine.
4. Run `server.py` to start the server.
5. Launch `client.py` for each client session.
6. Follow the bid and notification process as per the demo.
